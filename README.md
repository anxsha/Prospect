# Prospect
This repo is a uni project in legacy OpenGL. Having launched the program, one can press F1 to start a game,
whose goal is to reach consecutively spawning yellow gates with a rover.

After pressing F1, the first gate appears. Passing through it causes another one to pop up (a total of 5 in fixed locations).

When all of them have been reached, the time result is shown on the building (below, two latest outcomes are visible).

Rover's mechanics support simple driving with turning, acceleration, braking (manual and through pseudo-friction).
Implemented is also rover's collision detection with a rock.
